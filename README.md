Ello! I'm technically @T3RM1N4T3D, but you can call me Lit (xLit, LitSkillz, whatever).<br>
Started coding at 11.

Main languages:<br>
Lua/luau<br>
Python<br>
Javascript (I hate it, but my school chromebook can run .js files :o)<br>

I enjoy coding roblox games (as of recent fighting scripts), since that's how I learned to code.
